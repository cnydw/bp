      <description>We were ejected out of the spaceship, now we are drifting in the universe. Sun is getting smaller and smaller, diminutive. The world is getting darker and darker.
A huge wall forms in front of us. The wall is bright, like a massive white screen. An apple suddenly came to my mind, the concept, the smell, the taste, the color, the nutrition of an apple are intertwined in my head, and bubble up from the bottom of my consciousness.</description>

      <description>Time is flying or flowing.
We are dying. Alcohol isn&amp;rsquo;t doing us any good, it makes us feel the time being slower, but in reality it just slowly kills us.
We are living. A dog is barking in front of us, a chihuahua is jumping and barking at a huge dinosaur, fearlessly. We laugh at the chihuahua, but we&amp;rsquo;ve got a lot to learn from this little creature. We&amp;rsquo;ve become too accustomed to being a processor.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t know why I am doing this, maybe it&amp;rsquo;s because I am crazy.
I am running around the square, no one cares.
I am running around the square, someone sees me.
I am running around the square, I feel wind.
I am running around the square, I wanna scream.
I am running around the square, I high five with every human I encounter.
I am running around the square, I have a QR code on my T-Shirt.</description>

      <description>When you want to hurry something, that means you no longer care about it and want to get on to other things.
McDonalds, McKinsey, CNN, iPhone, Google, Moon landing, what are they?
Slow down. I want to start farming, but I don&amp;rsquo;t have a field. No need to hurry, let&amp;rsquo;s just steal some soil first.</description>

      <description>Huh, 2021 finished, 2021 is certainly different than 2020, but how?
COVID-19 is still here, humans are still not extinct. We saw reports of different animals getting infected, but the virus doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be doing much to them, thank god.
When we drink water, water goes through us, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t stay, just like time. We are drinking the same water dinosaurs were drinking millions of years ago.
I saw a mummy, the hair and nails were like they are from yesterday, she is beautiful and probably was as well.</description>

      <description>Communist, Donald Trump, Washington state, Washington, D.C., The falling man, H&amp;amp;M, Germany, Mao Zedong, God, Universe, You and Me.
All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain. Time to die.
An endless party is waiting for us.</description>

      <description>Mind is a weird concept. 1 21 guns, lay down your arms, give up the fight.
1 21 guns, throw up your arms, into the sky, you and I~
What shall I do to not give a fuck? I am too sensitive, too concerned, too worried, too sarcastic, too pessimistic about my life. I am giving too much fuck for living a good life which itself makes the life miserable. Maybe I should take a moment to forget/forgive myself and worry about climate change.</description>

      <description>Fuck yeah, 2020 is finished.
I will miss you, you little, naughty, cute, cunt, crazy, badass, punk, pure, innocent virus.
I had a dream with you last night, it could be the new strain, the old strain, or a strain yet to come.
In the dream, the virus was in tears.
&amp;ldquo;I just want to have my children, my grandchildren, you know, it&amp;rsquo;s in my gene, like you guys.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Yes, I know, calm down, it&amp;rsquo;s not your fault.</description>

      <description>I am dying, we are dying, the universe is dying. A comforting fact.
I don&amp;rsquo;t care if my soul still exists after I die, I don&amp;rsquo;t care if I go to heaven or hell after I die, I don&amp;rsquo;t care if you will miss me after I die, I don&amp;rsquo;t care if I will have another life after I die, I don&amp;rsquo;t care.
But I do like to imagine the death of our universe.</description>

      <description>My jokes aren&amp;rsquo;t working out, but people laugh when my jokes aren&amp;rsquo;t working out, so my jokes are working out.
What a pathetic clown, I am not even a scary clown, I am just a harmless clown, a bug, a cookie, a bag of fine granulated sugar.
I am tired of telling not working out jokes, I want to be more important, maybe the president of the United State, a plumber, a writer, a reporter, a twitch just chatting host, a high school physics teacher, a prisoner, just not a clown.</description>

      <description>I have a trash can that becomes a fly base in the summer.
The shiny metallic color female flies always find a way to lay eggs inside the trash can. In no time the eggs become cute squirming larvas, then pupae, then flies that fly.
The stinky smell attracts the flies. Vinegar also attracts flies, because Acetic acid is produced when fruit ferments.
I take the trash bag out, squeeze the air out (which stinks), and tie the bag.</description>

      <description>I mistaken the salt for sugar and put it in my coffee. To my surprise it tasted quite good, so I recommended it to my friends, and they were amazed by the taste of the magical combination too. I quitted my job and opened a cafe selling salted coffee. Sugar is a taboo in my cafe. In a rainy midnight, while I was preparing to close the shop, a girl carrying loads of water drops came inside , and ordered a coffee with sugar and milk.</description>

      <description>I need a doctor.
Does a doctor need another doctor? Does a barber need another barber? Does a teacher need another teacher? Does a husband need another husband? Does a president need another president? Does a vacuum cleaner need another vacuum cleaner?
I need a banana. I need some water. I need an apple.
Apple is an old fruit. When you eat an apple, you also digest the history. In the night, I imagine my ancestors, what&amp;rsquo;s inside the mind of my grandpa&amp;rsquo;s grandpa&amp;rsquo;s grandpa?</description>

      <description>Rapture, ecstasy.
Jump! Let the blood flow, let the heart beat, let the brain lose its mind.
I wanna be dead!
Why don&amp;rsquo;t you kill me&amp;hellip;
You mean, painfulness is a part of life? I don&amp;rsquo;t know, man, my friend. I am in love with somebody. She is a robot, an air doll, a computer, artificial intelligence, regression, matrices, linear algebra, apple, salt, tonic water, condom, toilet paper, menstruation or copper.</description>

      <description>Beds and coffins are both made of wood, just that coffins have a lid.
I am tired of all these bullshit, my dear friend, sometimes I want to kill myself :( But I am not gonna commit it, no worries :)
Bed, womb, tomb, comb, coffin, iPhone, they seem to be the same thing to me. I hope I am not insane. I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to be a sane man. I want to be as normal as you.</description>

      <description>In case you don&amp;rsquo;t know it, vodka can be put in the freezer. The melting point of ethanol is -114.14°C. When you pour frozen(I mean from the freezer, not literally frozen) vodka out, the liquid is sticky and together, interesting physics.
Drinking pure vodka is a bit boring, it tastes like alcohol and nothing else. D wants to make it more exciting, D bites his finger, and puts the bleeding finger in the glass.</description>

      <description>We live in bubbles.
I was naive, I am naive, I will be naive.
I thought the brutality conducted by Hong Kong police was the result of the infiltration of PLA, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t believe that the local police would do those horrible things to their own innocent citizens. But that idea was challenged after watching the footages from the Minneapolis, New York, and other places in the US.
The police crush the crowd with their huge SUVs, they push the elderly down to the ground, they shoot the reporters, they beat the protesters, they worsen the situation.</description>

      <description>Life is full of hints.
Your cat has been hanging out lately. You have a window, your cat sneaks out to have some fun with the grass, wind, cola cans, trees, other cats, dogs, humans, supermarket, police station, train station.
The weird thing is that when you come back home, your cat is always in the house. You open the door, your cat jumps to you, meows, follows you around, swings around your calfs, showing the ultimate intimacy.</description>

      <description>Every time you wake up, you are reborn.
Especially when it&amp;rsquo;s a weird time to wake up, like 2 am, or 10 pm. You feel detached, confused, wondering what is going on around you. You are like a new baby, you are frightened by the environment, you want to cry, but you are too old to cry. You want a protector, but you are alone.
The memory gradually fills your consciousness, you are no longer a headless fly.</description>

      <description>In epidemiology, the basic reproduction number $R_0$ of an infection can be thought of as the expected number of cases directly generated by one case in a population where all individuals are susceptible to infection. In commonly used infection models, when $R_0 &amp;gt; 1$ the infection will be able to start spreading in a population, but not if $R_0 &amp;lt; 1$.
What about politics? The reproduction/spread of an ideology is so similar.</description>

      <description>A wasp just came into my room. I was hearing an overwhelming buzz noise, I turned around, found a object flying in my room without any direction.
The wasp was huge, I flew (without flying) out the room immediately by instinct.
I was able to hear the buzz sound made by the wasp outside the closed door, so I waited and waited, until the sound was gone. Then I opened the door cautiously, the used to be familiar room became a war field, I examined everything with care.</description>

      <description>Learnt a word from Russell Brand today, onanism.
There are a thousand paths in front of us, which one do we choose? Which one are we currently on? Do we recognize the difference between the dream and reality? If yes, are we trying to minimize the gap? Do we just let the feeling guide us? Is the invisible hand pushing us down the cliff?
I don&amp;rsquo;t think I can go with a permanent path, even in my rather limited life span.</description>

      <description>With the coronavirus (COVID-19 they call it) going around, the world is slowing down.
Empty streets, empty shopping malls, empty museums, empty restaurants, empty whatever, a quiet world.
Two places are still as vibrant as hell, hospitals and supermarkets. And of course, the Internet.
Being stuck in my room, I am forced to use my brain from time to time to not get bored. I&amp;rsquo;ve come up with various questions.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s running too fast. My brain is running too fast.
I am not saying I am smart of any kind.
It&amp;rsquo;s not painful, it&amp;rsquo;s just boring, boring is worse than painful.
Drink some alcohol.
Oh time is slowing down!
Stupid! If time slows down, you will feel more with the same amount of time.
So time is running faster?
What is time?
I am not drunk, I am just imagining me being drunk.</description>

      <description>Talking without asking questions is announcement.
I talk to myself a lot, I ask myself various questions. Some Go players play against themselves to improve themselves, I ask myself questions to beat myself, to frustrate myself, to be lost, to be alive.
 Why do rich people play golf? What would a world with seven billion clones of me be like? Why do we have cute cats? Why do we have people who don&amp;rsquo;t like cute cats?</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s a nightmare, let&amp;rsquo;s escape.
How do you escape a nightmare? You do crazy things to break the system. You try to hurt yourself, you try to hurt others, you drink phlegm, you scream, you jump, you fly, you fall, you roll, you sink.
But the entire system is a simulation composed of imaginations, it&amp;rsquo;s not easy to jump out of your own brain, yet you keep thinking the normal laws apply here.</description>

      <description>Rob had a record of sleepwalking since he was seven years old. During sleep, he gets out of bed, goes to the bathroom, looks into the mirror. The light of the bathroom hits his face, reflected, goes to the mirror, reflected, travels through his cornea, hits his retina. His own image, composed by light waves of different intensity and wavelength, gets translated by the cone cells and rod cells to a bunch of electro-chemical impulses, also known as neural signals.</description>

One company gives me salary, one company gives me something.
One company during the day, one company during the night.
One company is a real company, one company is a virtual entity.
One company sees me as an employee, one company sees me as the only employee.
The second company is myself. I am an employee to myself. I employ myself. I am being a master and a slave at the same time.</description>

I, the fart king, like elevators. I fart without sound, then I observe people&amp;rsquo;s reactions. Some people pretend nothing happened, some people start cursing, some people frown, some people smile, some people clench their fists, some people look around.
What happens occasionally is that while I think I am farting, but I am actually shitting.</description>

      <description>In the silicon-based world, people like overclocking. They use refrigerator, fan, water, liquid nitrogen or whatever to cool the CPU, hence increasing the computing power.
In the carbon-based world, people like underclocking. They use alcohol as the main ingredient to slow down the brain.
Are we too smart? I don’t think so.

      <description>If we were to really reduce the carbon footprint of human beings, we need to remove all barbershops and praise being bald.
Everyone gets a hair clipper so they can become bald at home. No more energy spent on dyeing, perm or hair drying.
The real bald people are happier since they become ordinary people again. Bald billionaires no longer need to waste tons of money seeking a cure for baldness.</description>

      <description>Many people think they fear cancer.
But when people really get cancer, many of them aren&amp;rsquo;t as frightened as they thought they would be. Instead, they start to think about questions that haven&amp;rsquo;t been thinking about, they discover the little treasures in life, they start to develop real relationships, they express their real feelings, they look at the sky and find connections of everything in the universe, they become philosophists.</description>

      <description>A siesta is a short nap taken in the early afternoon.
Dreams in the afternoon are different than the night ones. They are bright, vivid, colorful yet dry, sad and nostalgic.
Dreams in the afternoon also increase the chance of sleep paralysis. Horrible things happen in front of your eyes, yet you can do nothing but watch it. The world is rotating, transforming and collapsing, there is no escape. You get struck by the horror, the memory fades away, then you experience the horror once again.</description>

      <description>We sense stuff. We see, smell, hear, taste, and touch.
Of course we are capable of more than sensing. We sense, we process, we output. Just like how a robot works.
What makes a human special is the processing step. But we are gradually losing that ability.
Stimuli are bypassing our brain. Stimuli become the output. The processing unit doesn&amp;rsquo;t work anymore, it short circuits the input to the output.</description>

If human beings were created by a superior being, let it be god or an alien, yet we are so ugly, contradictory, stupid and narcissistic, I can think of some reasons.
 The superior being, let&amp;rsquo;s call it it, was already doing its best. -&amp;gt; It was stupid. It deliberately made us so. -&amp;gt; We are an experiment to it, the earth is (maybe) the largest zoo in the universe.</description>

Years ago, when F was building the house, he was not bald. He had hope for life. He put a spectacular bathtub in the bathroom, he designed a walk-in robe near his bedroom.</description>

A good shit experience feels nice, maybe that explains why we are always excreting.
We eat food and produce excrement. We inhale fresh air and produce foul air. We take a shower and produce tons of polluted water. We fight and produce corpses. We consume Coca-Cola and produce commercials of nonsense. We put flowers in a vase and produce dead flowers. We buy new phones and produce dead phones in the drawer.</description>

      <description>We are nothing but language. But I am sick of our languages.
The language we use is rudimentary. Use math as an analogy, our language only knows additions and subtractions, and while doing this basic operation it includes a lot of redundant steps with unneeded zeros. It&amp;rsquo;s slow, ambiguous, obscure, twisted, vague and toxic.
I wish there is a just language, a powerful language, a simple language, a perfect language, a language that conveys messages without distortion, a language that allows people to express their feelings without hesitation, a language that connects people.</description>

J is a man or a woman? I don&amp;rsquo;t know. J is mysterious. J likes M.</description>

E likes this timer idea, so she uses this methodology to think about the methodology itself.</description>

      <description>$$\mathbf{p} = m\mathbf{v}$$
Where there is mass and velocity, there is momentum. Being a vector, it has a direction.
The momentum of the human&amp;rsquo;s mindset is a multidimensional vector, and it&amp;rsquo;s changed through collisions. The collision happens when we are reading, listening, touching, and of course, thinking. Everything we experience contributes to this matrix transformation.

You feel absolute pleasure when you get rid of a chunk of nasty phlegm in your throat. It&amp;rsquo;s similar to a good defecation experience. But people are more familiar with defecation, so diluting the pleasure.
There was a joke that&amp;rsquo;s been impressing me since I was a kid.
Two guys walk into a theater, they see a spittoon in the corner. So they make a bet, the one with the courage to take a bite of the phlegm in the spittoon gets a free movie ticket from the other one.</description>

C moved to the island because he was tired of things. He thought moving to an island would straighten things out for him. The outcome wasn&amp;rsquo;t positive, people say.

Invisible cables have become cellular automaton, they own the world now. People don&amp;rsquo;t realize it, they are happy because they don&amp;rsquo;t see the nasty messy cables anymore.
Humans become the host of these invisible cables. Symbiosis.

      <description>B is American. B is happy.
B owns a small match factory. Every morning, the sun rises, B gets up and goes to work.
It seems matches are not being used anymore, yet logs are delivered to the factory every day. B moves the logs to the machine. The machine rotates the log while slowly pushing it to a long and sharp blade. The bark is gone, the wood gets cut to thin wood paper, like a red carpet being rolled out.</description>

      <description>M seems depressed. He doesn&amp;rsquo;t enjoy talking.
When being involved in a conversation unconsciously, he closes his eyes, imagining he is a 🐳 in the deep sea.
Meaningless sentences hit his tympanic membrane. M, now a 🐳, considers them water flow. He feels their existence, but couldn&amp;rsquo;t care less.
When a 🐳 gets tired of the tranquil lifestyle underwater, it jumps out of water. So does M.
M jumps out of the water.</description>

      <description>Kickwalker is a kickstarter-like thing for demonstrations, protests, marches, or whatever you call it (I would like to call it &amp;ldquo;people with similar interests taking a walk together&amp;rdquo;).
Hence the name: kickwalker.
To create a kickwalker project, you (a single person, a NGO or a GOV department) select the category of the walk, describe the idea of the walk, choose the city of the walk, etc. After the project is created, you could share the project to friends, relatives and strangers by facebook, twitter, youtube, letters, flyers, newspaper ads, TV ads, Times Square screens, or whatever.</description>

傍晚，他跑过大街
光线扭转着被他吞噬
路边有人说，天黑啦
他说: 天会亮的
接着，人们便都被吸进去了
黑洞狗变得越来越大，他哭了
泪水喷涌而出，成了一颗颗星星
黑洞狗成了神
他奔跑在宇宙每一个角落
放肆地嚎叫</description>

&amp;ldquo;死掉不是和躺一会儿差不多吗？&amp;rdquo;

      <description>昨天，去东交民巷的中国国旅办认证，正好，跟天安门离得很近。办了认证，我便徒步走去天安门，想感受一下民众与当局共同创造的和谐气氛。
下着小雨，走着走着便见着最高人民法院，没见着官司，倒是有几位兄弟和门卫吵起来了。
我接着往前走，见着了法国使馆旧址，门口透明岗亭里站着个中国兵，很是威武。我使劲瞄他，他就是一动不动。
再往前走，到了日本使馆旧址。门口也站着个中国兵，眼睛却始终瞄着我，我不敢像刚才看那士兵一样看他了。我默默往前走，用余光看着他。他好像对我很好奇，眼神一直死死地抓住我。我想回头对他微笑一下，斗争了一下还是放弃了这个念头。我想到了前阵子西安兵马俑那事，一恐龙给一执勤武警擦汗。不由得一阵反胃，头也不回，加速向前走。
终于，我过了安检，进了天安门。撑着伞，我向着北方前进。广场里没什么人，我看了会儿长安街的车来车往，想到了似乎有一段时间为了防止外抛传单，出租车都卸掉了摇手。
汽车们仍旧飞驰着。忽然听见一阵嚷嚷，我转身。
五六个老太太，每人手里一片布条，上面似乎写着什么，没人能看清。
她们用她们那驼背的臂膀，昂起头颅，高举着布条，摇动着。同时，嘴里嚷嚷着一些话，尽管很用力地诉说，但没人能听懂。
但是警察们马上听懂，看懂了。
她们这是颠覆政权! 是要给你国下马威! 是境外不法分子手中的枪! 是破坏中国梦的老鼠屎!
十秒钟内，三个警察便站在他们身边，呵斥她们停下。
二十秒内，又多了几个统一穿着白衬衣的神秘男子。他们一面跟警察窃窃私语，一面对着对讲机吼叫着。
四十秒内，一辆警用面包车开到了她们身边。
警察们并不暴力，他们轻轻地推搡着，让她们上去，她们哭丧得更厉害了，却也一个个地上去了。
车门关闭的一瞬间，我不再能够听见她们的声音。
看着那警车缓缓倒车，驶离。我忽然哭了。
并不是那种细水长流的眼泪，而似乎是泪腺像气球一样，吹呀，吹呀，忽然爆炸了。
车走了，几个警察却没走。他们开始要检查围观群众的身份证。我低头，走开了。
似乎有几个中年妇女被缠上了，听口音像是广西人。
抱团而来的她们并不主动交出身份证，相反，她们要求看警官证。
出示了警官证之后，她也不配合。问道，你凭什么要求检查我的身份证?
警察说了半天自己有权力要求，她有义务配合。
忽然来了一警察说，我认得你! 上次也是你!
她们被磨得没办法了，便交了上去，但并没完。
她拨通了110，&amp;ldquo;你好，我在天安门，我被警察拦住，他一定要查我的身份证，而且态度非常恶劣!我要投诉他!&amp;quot;，打着电话同时凑到警察面前去看他的编号。电话那头似乎犯难了，也许说了&amp;quot;我们也无能为力&amp;quot;之类的话。
她不让，说&amp;quot;我要求你们立刻出警!&amp;rdquo;
我猜不出电话那头的接线员是什么反应。终于，磨了一阵子后，她放下了手机。
警察挨个扫过身份证后，逐个归还。
一位年轻警察似乎也上头了，对她们嚷着，&amp;ldquo;我来告诉你们，这是依法行事。根据治安法和天安门地区管理规定，我有权对你们进行身份核实。&amp;rdquo; 如此云云。
而她们则回应，&amp;ldquo;你这是选择性执法!&amp;rdquo;
年轻警察还想回应，被边上的大叔警察拉走了。
雨停了，阳光照射在积了水的天安门地面。
我看到清洁工们铲着水，让它们尽快消失。
我看到士兵们脱下雨衣雨裤。
我看到毛泽东纪念堂开出了一辆车，里面有两个兵。
副驾驶座上的他在玩着苹果手机。
啊，多么有意义的一天。</description>

      <title>死人</title>

      <description>几周前，午夜十二点，去阳台收衣服，撑杆收起的时候，感觉一些多余的光子撞进了我的视网膜。我把头转向窗外，一辆救护车正头顶闪着蓝光徐徐驶进。宿舍楼下不寻常的站了许多人。我感觉疑惑，有人急性病发作了? 脑中跳转到一个高三的晚上，也是一辆救护车开进学校，在紫藤架下穿过，把路占得满满当当。后来得知是一个女生贫血晕倒了。于是我也想当然地觉得这是某位学生晕倒了。
然而，他却是死掉了。我看见救护车周围的几个人，手中亮起了手电筒，照向了地上的同一块区域。我顺着灯光看去，见着有一个大圆柱体压在路面上，而它周围被拉上了警戒线。我觉得疑惑，再仔细看，那儿躺着一个人，一动不动。灯光偶尔闪到他身边，我能看到他的头，还有他头下的地面，粘上了血而变得暗红的地面。我不自觉地叫了出来。
医生似乎确认他已经死了，走开了。几个警察凑近了他，拿起了相机，对准他，毫无审美的不同角度，闪光灯隔五六秒便会闪一次，让他在深夜里变得格外醒目。我这时却在想，警察用的是什么设备? 全画幅? 卡片机? 北京的警察局用的相机会比我家乡的警察局用的相机高级吗? 为什么他不外接一个硕大的闪光灯? 这样对死者尊重吗，被这么廉价而拙劣的方式记录死亡，这是多么的不堪啊。
警察们拍完照，钻出警戒线，聚在警车边，抽起了烟。
他们一定习惯了，北京有这么多人，有这么多成功，有这么多欲望，有这么多失意。必然的，会有这么多的自杀。
香烟的火光一闪一闪的，我不再看。
第二天，警戒线没了，尸体没了，血迹没了，一切照常，一切照常。</description>

      <description>上次，斜对面坐着一个大叔，已经记不起他脚上穿着的是破皮鞋还是破运动鞋，穿着大衣，灰的，破旧得发黑。他的头低垂下来，用大衣把自己的脸捂住。我看不见他的脸，只能看见他的头发杂乱而固结地向后颈延伸。我用相同的频率麻木地把薯条往嘴里塞，视线始终不能离开他。并没有睡着，他时不时扯一扯衣服，以让自己的头更好地埋进去，始终没有让脸露出来。
座位都满了，几个谈笑风生的女生，端着餐盘走近，见这样的他坐着，眉头一皱，绕走了。
这次，另一位，破运动鞋，灰西裤，西装，手上拿着5，6盒薯条，游走在麦当劳餐厅。他见有人走了，留下餐盘在原地，便去收走，剩什么拿什么。
我点了板烧套餐，见他这样，想留下一盒没吃过的薯条给他。可他却又离我很远，我想递给他，可又害怕见着他的反应。
我把薯条扔进嘴里，一根，两根，三根。。。塞满了我的嘴，尝不出味道。
吃完了，我走了，我不再看他。</description>

      <description>我受不了了，从口袋里掏出手机，解锁，拨号，点下了110三个数字后，盯着屏幕看了几秒，又把它们消除。我四处张望，发现了一个电话亭，走了过去。
蹑手蹑脚地走近了电话亭，我拿起了听筒，还没把它靠近耳边就听到了那久违的，连续的嘟声。不知怎的，心里涌起了一股暖意。我强迫自己按下110，却又不知该说些什么。
终于，在有人接听前，我放下了听筒，转身离开。现在已经是深夜了，我把拉链拉到头还是不能挡住那坚强的寒风。我不知该去哪儿，周边除了电话亭，还有一家小吃店，店里并没有什么人，但我可以看见里面有一桌大叔在喝着二锅头，那历经沧桑的手时不时抬起，指着对方，又指天花板，嘴中说着些南海布局与家庭关系之类的东西，伴随着他不住地张嘴，合嘴，一股股坚毅的精神在我的脑中萌发，成长。小吃店边上，有一家小卖铺，店老板坐在靠近门口的破柜台，他前方不远处摆着一台CRT电视机，里面正放着还珠格格，他看得津津有味。我有点口渴，但又不想打扰老板，便在门口看了会儿电视，走开了。
我走到了桥上，看到有人坐在河边钓鱼，他还开着一个手电，发出不真实的白光。现在大概是晚上十一点了吧? 他不在家里歇着却跑出来钓鱼? 我默默地想。他似乎听见了，关掉了手电，我几乎看不见他了。
过了桥，便是十年前，我还是个小孩。
我喜欢玩皮球，我喜欢在家门口拍皮球，还喜欢踢它。所谓的皮球，其实是个篮球，但是我喜欢踢它，胜过拍它。有一天，我踢了它一脚，它跑到了马路中央，我便追着它，不想让它跑走。我追着追着，我发现身边的汽车都不见了，取而代之的是各种各样的小朋友，小朋友们跑来跟我争夺那皮球。尽管我第一个跑到了皮球边上并使它停住了，却发现身边聚集了一群群的小朋友，他们有男有女，有大有小。我并不害怕他们，我左手把皮球捂在胸前，右手从口袋里掏出一把小刀，朝着皮球便扎，皮球瞬间便被扎破了，发出了砰的一声巨响，变成了一张皮。我的小刀继续深入，扎破皮球的两层皮，继续深入，扎破了我的第一层皮。我的血向外流出，就像那皮球流出气体似的。
我的右手把小刀一扔，由于小刀上还扎着皮球，它们便一起飞出去了。皮球不住地向下滴血，我哭了。忽然间，我觉得被我扔出去的好像是一串羊肉串，可实际上串的是偷米的小老鼠的肉。
羊肉串在空中飞翔，周围的孩子们开始自发地叠罗汉，我不知怎的便成了在那三角形上方的顶点。我踩着脚下的孩子们，轻轻一跳，坐上了羊肉串，它带着我在空中飞翔。我回头看了看罗汉们，他们被我一踩，都倒下了，各自躺在草地上，边上还有一个自动浇水机，水浇在他们身上，罗汉们身上的衣服碰了水，渐渐变得透明，降解，消失了。我看到他们的肉体，微风吹过，头发轻轻飞扬，好漂亮啊。
我后悔自己刚刚跳上了这愚蠢的肉串，可是上了贼船就没办法了，只好做一个贼啦。当一个美丽纯洁的孩子，只能是我的梦了。
我不能控制肉串飞行的方向，它忽地向上飞，我夹在两个肉串之间，便顺势抓紧前方那块肉。
那块肉如果会思考，应该会想&amp;quot;后面那块肉怎么这么有力量！&amp;ldquo;吧。
可谁知道我不是一块肉呢?
肉串笔直地向上飞去，不一会儿便穿过了云层。云层上面有裸体的angel和太白金星。我正想仔细看看他们，却发现肉串飞得实在太快，一眨眼他们便消失成小点了。
看样子，我离地球越来越远了。&amp;ldquo;这上头真是令人心旷神怡呀!&amp;quot;，我紧抓着肉串，扭头对着大地上的芸芸众生喊道。
没人理会我的疯言疯语，真是再好不过了。我一直渴望能够逃离地面。人类在地面上努力构筑自己的家，晚上在家里睡觉，白天出去工作。以我现在的高度来看，他们跟辛苦筑巢的蚂蚁没什么两样。只不过他们给自己创造了一些享受的方式，一些虚无而脆弱的人生的盼头。他们以地球的主人自居，一些专家学者们甚至认为人类是宇宙中唯一的智慧生物。呵呵，真是太可爱啦。</description>

      <description>你那戏谑一切的能力呢，怎么渐渐看不见了? 取而代之的却是一股股的认真劲儿，面对虚妄的世界努力寻找答案，可你明明早就明白，根本没有出口。
于是你编造，你欺上瞒下，最终成功地骗到了自己。编织出一个硕大的蜘蛛网，终于，有一天，你装作一只蚊子，或是一只麻雀，不顾一切地撞进了蛛网。蛛网是智能的，它迅速蜷缩起来，把你裹住。由蛋白质构成的蛛网当一床被子不错，你觉得挺舒服的。可渐渐，你发现自己有点喘不过气来了。
喘不过气的你，绝望地吐出舌头，试图制造出一种可爱的死法。
你睡着了，梦里的你，自由飞翔，作为一只蚊子(或是麻雀之类的东西)，你开心地享受，你吸血，你躲闪，你躲闪，你逃出蚊帐，紧接着还得逃离菊酯，你发现你无处可去。这时，你发现，你只可能是蚊子，因为一只麻雀是不能够那么轻易飞进蚊帐而又那么轻易地飞出去的。
你顺着窗户的缝出去，忽然发现，你碰到了一只匀称漂亮的青蛙，它盯着你。你不想被它消化，便回头。
你发现这一切都是由那可笑的蜘蛛控制的，你在自己经常出没的床边拐角找到蜘蛛网，却看不见那蜘蛛。
你心想，不管了! 吼叫着，便要撞在那网上。
你的确这么做了，你吼叫的是，&amp;ldquo;让我们同归于尽&amp;rdquo;。(也许仅仅是一些嗡嗡声，谁知道呢
你如愿了，你被卷进去了。
你拥有一床蛋白质被子了，你自语道，这比昂贵的蚕丝被还要滑呢。然后，
你拥有一套蛋白质囚服了，你自语道，这比愚蠢的羽绒服还要暖呢。终于，
你拥有一套蛋白质绞刑架了。</description>

      <description>一个醉鬼，穿着土绿军大衣，破洞的旧皮鞋，晃晃悠悠地向我走来。我本能地避开了他，他并没看着我，眼睛盯着地面，上半身大幅度地摇摆，嘴中嘟囔着一些没人听得懂的东西，向我后方走去。我继续向前走着，过了一会儿，转头看去，他依旧晃晃悠悠地走，边上的路人努力装作没看见他。一瞬间，我想到了那个后勤保障中心的工人，他在学校超市里问收银员有没有二锅头，可惜，只有啤酒。他什么都没有买，走了。</description>

      <description>他们吵架了。
他坐在椅子上，双手支着饭桌，握着一只玻璃杯，杯里是开水，他喝着，半天也没喝完。她坐在沙发上，双眼直愣愣盯着电视，电视里正放着广告，跑步机，洗发露，耐克，节约用水，关爱父母，最后终于回到了她的电视剧。电视剧里的皇后很有手段，她控制了他的老公，即皇上，于是她便控制了中国。坐在沙发上的她看不见背后的东西，她只觉得扮演皇后的演员很漂亮，如果皇后不穿着那么厚，那么庄重而愚蠢的衣服，应该会更好看。皇上出现了，皇上和皇后一起，皇后给皇上出谋划策，皇上连连称是，夸赞皇后聪明还美丽。
他终于喝完水了，右手拿着玻璃杯，屁股脱离椅子，走到了洗碗槽那儿。水龙头喷出的冷水冲刷着玻璃杯，也冲刷着他的手。关上水龙头，他把玻璃杯倒着甩了甩，试图甩干它，接着便把它放在一边。
他打开冰箱，发现里面还有几罐啤酒，便拿出一罐，在沙发的另一头坐下。他拉起拉环，&amp;ldquo;啪&amp;rdquo;，啤酒里的二氧化碳发出声音。他喝了一口，把它放在沙发前的茶几上，全身向后躺去，陷进了沙发里。这集电视剧终于结束了，皇后依旧是皇后，皇上则越来越被动。听完片尾曲，她毫不客气拿起了啤酒，也喝了一口，放回原位。
过了好一会儿，陷在沙发里的他打了个嗝，或者是放了个屁，没有人记得了。她笑了，争吵结束了。</description>

      <description>为什么在忽然遭受重大变故，灾难的时候，承受者们有时会开心地大笑，呈现出一种歇斯底里的症状，并且从心底里感到高兴呢? 他们也许会先流露出哀伤的情绪，而后忽然亢奋地大笑，随后默不作声。或者略过哀伤的过程，直接进入大笑环节，最后默默地坐着，似乎沉思着一些东西。
在这时，眼泪所包含的东西极其有限。
蹦出了一个解释。人类安逸地生活着，就像在一个飞艇，航空母舰上，空间站里。然而人们始终想念着陆地上的生活，尽管有恐龙，蜥蜴，阴晴不定的天气，细菌，病毒。这种思念是蚀刻在基因里的。而人类在遭受灾难时，便拥有了一种贴地感，那杀戮，死亡，阴沉的回归。如同动物园里三餐规律的孙悟空，被扔进了峨眉山，撒哈拉大沙漠，喜马拉雅，百慕大三角。</description>

      <description>现在的情况是，我正在水里精疲力竭地游泳，我从悬崖向下跳去，因为只有这一条路可走。
我掉进了冷得刺骨的水中，向四周看去，没有岸，只有一望无际的水，我冷，只好向前游去，奋力地向前游去。我的牙齿开始打战，我的肌肉开始不听使唤，我的头脑清醒得像透明的宇宙，我不能停，我想&amp;hellip;我努力向前游着，游着，游着。终于，我见到岸了，我看见岸了！我加快速度，游上了岸。却发现，岸上有好多蚂蚁，它们聚在一起游荡着，组成漆黑的一团，寻找着猎物。我想，它们能够在几分钟内便将我吞噬。我向前跑去，蚂蚁们也注意到了我这个活物，黑压压的一片向我缓慢地移来。我害怕，我跑，身上的水滴在地上，蒸发在空气中，我冷，比在水里还冷。
不一会儿，我停住了，我跑到了一片悬崖，下面不是山谷，而是海。我知道，那片蚁群仍跟着我，它们渐渐能被看见了。我无处可去，向下看去，水面平静。它们已经来到我身边了，黑压压的一片。我试图赶走它们，可根本无济于事。有蚂蚁已经顺着我的赤脚，爬上我的小腿，大腿&amp;hellip;它们不仅仅向上爬，还在努力地噬咬，咬我的皮，想要吃我的血。我受不了这种羞辱，我后退几步，踩死了几个脚掌的蚂蚁，再向前跑去，又踩死几脚掌的蚂蚁。接着，腾空跃起，向下落去。
现在的情况是，我正在水里精疲力竭地游泳，我从悬崖向下跳去，因为只有这一条路可走。</description>

      <description>我的头发是棕色的，眼睛是黑色的。
终于到了。过了这个门，我就能到一个过去没有人，未来也不会有人的地方。没有人将和我一起生活。我渴望独居很久了。
转动门把手，轻推开门，里面原来是一间屋子。我侧身进去，推上了门。屋内瞬间便被黑暗笼罩着，我试图再打开门，让光线照入以看清房间，却发现，门已经不存在了。
刚才开门时，我看到，屋子里有一具皮沙发，一个茶几，一张床，一张毯子。有没有电灯? 我不记得了。
我不再在意是否有灯光，我累了。我借着记忆摸索到床沿，躺上床，盖上毯子便闭上了眼睛。
 公园里，情侣们在拉着手走动，老人们做着拉伸运动，小孩们在草丛里蹦跳着。我在人工湖中央的小岛里，观察着周围。他们似乎都不能发现我。我想要离开小岛，却做不到。我不会游泳，而且水很脏。我在小岛里转圈，人们的脸上都有一种微笑，却似乎不太自然。
看了一会儿，我累了。我捡起脚边的一块石头，扔进水里。不知为什么，没有水波出现。它只是愣愣地下沉。
 我醒了，睁开眼睛，什么也看不见。脸颊感受着枕头的柔软，仔细听，周围似乎有一个挂钟。现在是几点? 这个问题也没有意义了。
忽然房门打开了，转瞬间，我置身于光明之中。同样的，在这光亮下，我无法睁开眼睛，我看不见任何事物。
&amp;ldquo;7号病人电疗失败。&amp;rdquo;
我死了。</description>

今日本人在路上走着，眼睛只顾看漂亮大蓝天，没见你们正在那几坨屎上享用美食，走过边上时把你们吓得四处乱飞，甚至还成群结队飞向我试图讨伐我，实在抱歉，实在抱歉。就让我以这一封小小的道歉信表达我诚挚的歉意。以后我一定努力不打扰你们吃屎，要不，给你们拉一堆屎作为补偿？

      <description>大家好，一模已经结束了，同学们也都得到了自己的成绩。恐怕大多数同学对自己的成绩并不满意，有同学会把这归咎于运气差，并期待着高考时幸运女神忽然宠幸于他，这是不大科学的。考试依靠自己对知识的积累、理解，而不是一场靠运气的赌博。一模让大家对自己各科的不足有了一个大致的了解，为接下来的80天指出了大致的努力的方向，这便是它的意义了。而不是盯着题目寻思着能不能让老师为自己多加上几分，名次上升几名。因而同学们所要做的是找到自己的薄弱点，不懈地将其攻克下来。当然，考试有不确定性，难免失常，同学也不必为自己的成绩过于焦虑，保持一颗平常心是很重要的，不骄不躁，求真务实，努力用好接下来的时间，不让自己后悔。大家都是聪明人，这点小道理自然是懂得的。可是将想法转变为行动并不是一件容易的事，因而大家更要努力奋斗。为父母、为班级、为学校、为国家，这都是强加的。我们要为自己奋斗，十班辉煌由我们创造，幸运女神将陪伴着我们！</description>

      <title>如果长生不老</title>

      <description>如果人类实现了长生不老，或许会是个很美丽的图景，相爱的人们永远一起看日出日落，人们的思维能力因不断积累上升到新的台阶，技术爆炸&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;
但这样的世界有个很可怕的BUG，极刑。倘若我被敲碎牙齿，手脚绑住塞进笼子里，肚子上插入塑胶管提取胆汁，且他们保证了我的永不死亡。这是件多么可怕的事儿啊。我无法选择死去，我必须永远承受这种痛苦，精神上的，肉体上的。把人打入十八层地狱放油锅里煎永世不得超生这么一说应该也是具备着相同性质的。
如果我有寿命，那么被抽胆汁的我的希望便是&amp;quot;死去一切便安宁了&amp;quot;，可倘若我知道了我将永远被关在笼子里抽胆汁且无法死去这个事实，那么我的心里会被什么充斥着？我要怎么办？西西弗斯日复一日地推动巨石上山顶，据说他是快乐的。那么我被插上塑胶管日复一日地抽胆汁，我大概也要以抽胆汁这事儿让自己快乐？我似乎必须要爱上这一过程？太可怕了。荒谬的自我意识，在那时如果能让我拥有一个技能，我希望是孙悟空的灵魂出窍。
后记：据说没人能憋气憋死自己，这是个令人难过的事实。食道塞入管子进食，肛门塞入管子排泄，身体失去行动力，永生被折磨，无法死去，这是多么可怕的事情啊！
写这么多不是为了传播邪教，只想让大家认识到目前的世界尽管粗糙，低俗，糟糕，充满谎言，但仍然是个美好的世界。我们能够见到太阳，我们我们能够欣赏美丽，我们能够享受自由。而不是在一个能够长生不老的时代，每个人都被大BOSS关在笼子里永生抽胆汁。</description>

      <description>标题本是坐下谈一谈，但恐不够屌，平等协商似的。又换成站起来谈一谈，想了想却又觉得站着谈不出什么。只好躺下啦，但可别躺在床上，那样大概也谈不出什么。躺在草坪上是再好不过了。
谈些什么？过去是坨没拉干净的屎，未来是片没拨开的雾。空谈让人斗志激昂却又让人不务正业。我只能谈谈现在，现在我该做什么？在这儿傻敲键盘是合适的选择吗？你在手机、电脑屏幕前看我这篇傻文是合适的吗？请想一想。
好，我思索了一会儿之后觉得在这个寒冷的屋子里傻敲键盘并不合适，所以我必须离开了。或许你想要看到一篇对新年充满希望的文章，但我恐怕写不出来啊。不过可以这样
请以”新年献词“为题，选一个角度，写一篇文章。字数不限
如果你真的这么做了，你对自己该做什么会有更加深刻的认识，效果一定比看一篇我写的弱智而充满希望的献词要好。
现在该干什么，这是个极好的问题。你身处现在，吹散未来那片雾，一切都在&amp;quot;现在&amp;quot;的掌控下渐渐变得清晰。
倘若累了，躺下谈一谈。
擦掉过去没拉干净的屎，新年快乐！</description>

      <description>日日同样的道路，轮胎被磨得没了棱角，糟糕的河水黑了又绿，绿了又黑。日日同样的自我，我的头发，长了又短，短了又长，思想，圣母般的思想转瞬间便能堕入地狱，后便对自己进行一番批判，再之后，便扭曲脸皮说道&amp;quot;沃草！&amp;ldquo;扭曲得可以挤出冰块了。逃脱这日日扭曲的法门可不是死亡。呵呵，匍匐于永恒轮回之中享受痛苦带来的快乐好呢，还是躺在摇篮里面对着从未经历过的一切噗哧一笑而哭 最终将死之时回首，同样噗哧一笑而后嚎啕大哭。即便神已死去，我们也无能力接管他留下的宇宙，或是自我。

      <title>日の志</title>

      <description>距离上篇挺远了
既然标题是日の志，就谈谈日子吧。
高中似乎存在着一股强大的吸引力将人的一切（时间啊！！！）吸去。至于何时人类能够进化到真正失去所有外部引力，而完全靠自己的能量产生反作用力而在漆黑宇宙中依着目标进行匀加速直线运动呢，过十个世纪也不可能吧。
前两天复习的时候，无聊时萌生了一个想法。
快递业的发展随着宅世界的发展而愈加强大（《别惹快递员，XXXXX》这篇很超时空），人们对快递的质量服务要求也越来越高。这时我有了一个无聊的想法：于地球表面构建真空管道（笔直且切面经过地心）以谋求零摩擦力，快递物品时将它放入特质容器里塞入隧道并给力（乃动词）使之获得≈8Km/s的速度，便可以很快到达你家了啊！！！！
当然。这实施起来难度是很大的 不如发射火箭再做圆周运动再降落。顺便求使↑方案更加无聊的改进措施（当然是更有爱的啊！！）
噢这真是一篇好日の志啊
昨晚拆开了陪伴了我两个冬天的笔记本。试图清理它的灰尘以不让我的手在即将到来的夏天成为烤蹄。然而笔记本的集成程度实在强大，我肢解了大约75%的零件一个外壳剩下了20+颗螺丝钉便伴随着破坏欲的充分释放与性感到爆棚的充实感匆匆睡去。（竟然没有急于求成而毁了它。）
今早起床啃了根玉米棒喝了杯牛奶便又继续着昨晚的工作。在拆机教程帖的帮助之下终于肢解之并成功地把灰尘大军赶跑了（好娇）/（把风扇用水洗了接着用电吹风吹干）。并且最重要的是我把它重新装回去了！！！而且我还剩下了5颗螺丝发现没有孔子给我钻了！！！而且它还给我正常工作了！！！而且我的手掌似乎也脱离了被活烤的风险且风扇再也不会无故地开机先啸叫几声了！！！！！既然这样一定要好好支持着哦~~ 我已经学会怎么调教你了呢~~
查了一下笔记本清理灰尘的市场价位大约50元左右。。剩下的5颗螺丝主要是因为拆机时没有进行分类管理，而在组装时进行滥交所致（滥交固然性福然而终有一天你会发现你得病啦！！）。如果你（的笔记本）拥有此症状（并非滥交诱发病）欢迎让我为您服务啊（谁知道呢#。）一星期修一次1小时够我吃一星期的晚饭了都。
这都是些很CJ的文字啊别给我想龌龊了！！
原来这就是日の志啊。
嗯。是的啊</description>
